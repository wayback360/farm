        <h1>MONEY</h1>
        <p>
            Money, A commodity accepted by general consent as a medium of economic exchange.
        </p>
        <p>
            It is the medium in which prices and values are expressed; as currency, it circulates anonymously from person to person and country to country, thus facilitating trade, and it is the principal measure of wealth.

        <h2>Fuctions of Money</h2>
        <p>
            The basic function of money is to enable buying to be separated from selling, thus permitting trade to take place without the so-called double coincidence of barter.
        </p>
        <p>
            In principle, credit could perform this function, but, before extending credit, the seller would want to know about the prospects of repayment.
